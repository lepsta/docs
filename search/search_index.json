To start using Lepsta, you need two things. An account on the Lepsta Platform . A Linux or macOS computer running Uju (our automatic version control tool). Note for users who have Windows OS. There is a firewall issue that we are currently battling with. As a temporary solution kindly install a VM to run Linux. Create a Lepsta Platform account \u00b6 To create a new account, click here . All you will need is your own email address, and a strong password. Alternatively, Lepsta lets you setup your account using third party authentication providers like Google, GitHub and Bitbucket. To ensure that you have captured your details correctly, you will be asked to verify your email address after signing up for a new account. Please check your email, also check your spam box if it doesnt appear on your primary inbox. Note Authorising your development computers to access your Lepsta Platform account still requires that you set up a password. So, even if you sign up with an OAuth service provider, you will be asked to set up a password, even though this might change in the future. Initial setup \u00b6 Please note, if you are a non-techincal person and you wont be writing coding using Lepsta, you can ignore the instructions below, however, you can still use Lepsta to manage yours and other people's tasks. Please see more here . If your code, keep reading. What is Uju Uju is a version control server designed specifically to work with the Lepsta Platform. You need to have it installed to contribute to your repositories and to collaborate with others. System Requirements \u00b6 Linux or Mac operating system. ( Recommended ) Windows operating system. Now that we understand what Uju is and what requirements we need,you can go ahead and click on add a different device to proceed. Installation instructions \u00b6 Linux or MacOs \u00b6 Depending on your operating system, you might have curl or wget preinstalled. You can install Uju by running one of these commands on your terminal. Install Uju curl https://lepsta.tech/get | sh Or wget -qO- https://lepsta.tech/get | sh Windows \u00b6 Windows version firewall issue Windows users are able to install and use Uju but they will quickly experience firewall issues. Please refer to known issues . Download Uju Locally \u00b6 For you to start working on your Lepsta repositories Uju needs to have access to your Lepsta Platform account. To authorize Uju, you need to login from the commandline interface. Simply run the following command, and you are good to go: uju login -u <username> OR Enter your username after promted by uju; Attention: Did any of these steps fail?

We are working on a fix for this issue. Note We are working on a fix for this issue. But just in case you come across it before we fix it, please take a look at this guide. Why does this happen? \u00b6 This happens as a result of a validation being performed on a repository. Version control works by creating chained revisions of changes that can reproduce the code you wrote at any point. Sometimes due to a bug in Uju or the user performing actions that the software is not expecting, this chain of revisions can be broken. This is when a repository is said to be in a bad/inconsistent state. Uju flags the streams that have an issue so that the user is aware of a problem in the relationships of the chained revisions. Most of the time if a stream is marked as inconsistent, it will stop accepting new changes from any client. We do this to mitigate the risk of corrupting existing changes with the new ones. How do I solve it? \u00b6 We support two ways of fixing this kind of issue. The most appropriate will depend on the effects on branches and streams: Commit and delete stream If the issue only affects a specific stream, Lepsta will recommend that you commit the changes in that stream (if any) on the web interface as a way to rescue your changes. Once you have done this, you can then delete the stream and run uju update locally. Once you've done this, you can create a new stream from the web interface and work from there. Restore the whole repository to an earlier point If the problem is affecting the entire repository, Lepsta will recommend that you restore the repository to an earlier point when it functioned correctly. Please use this as a last resort because it is possible to lose changes from say the past 5 minutes. To reduce the effects of this, Uju will backup all local copies of the repository and re-download the new version of the online repository. This means that if you had some changes not committed or replicated, you will not lose them. We hope that you find this helpful. Please feel free to contact us if you are having any problems.

Architecture Summary \u00b6 Lepsta provides a collaboration and automation service to developers through a cloud based platform structured in a 3-tiered architecture. Making up the tiers are two software parts that work together to make the service possible. This obviously excludes supporting services such as databases, caching applications and other general purpose parts. Uju (client) \u00b6 Uju (means Honey is Zulu), is a version control tool designed specifically for use with the Lepsta platform. To use Lepsta, you need to download and install Uju on your development computer. Uju runs in the background, managing data syncing, networking, versioning and more. Since Uju always knows where your repositories are sitting, it can listen to the changes you are making to provide an automation interface that can be used to improve your workflows. Platform (cloud) \u00b6 Note Even though we refer to this platform as being on the cloud, there might be options to have it deployed in your own infrastructure. But for the purpose of creating a mental picture, we will use \"the cloud\" as an example here. The online (cloud) platform is a managed application that allows developers to collaborate with one another. This is where developers can review each other's changes, manage their streams, accounts, access control and more. Repositories are created on this platform, then Uju clients are able to connect and synchronise changes over the internet. To use Lepsta, you will need to create an account . Uju (server) \u00b6 Uju is also used on our servers to host and manage Lepsta repositories. The Platform provisions repositories using the server version of Uju that sits in our infrastructure.

Lepsta allows you to either create a brand new repository, or Import (link) an existing Git repository. Brand new repo If you chose this option, your repository will be created on the Lepsta Platform, and will not be linked with an existing repository. Import from GitHub This option will allow you to create a repository as a mirror of an existing Git repository hosted on Github. This means that the two repositories will become linked and changes will be synced between the two of them.

# Manage streams
This is where it gets exciting. Creating a stream means you are ready to stary working on your shiney project. This is where the power of Lepsta is maximized. We encourage you to start by planning your work by creating streams on the ``work`` tab as shown below:

### Create a new stream
To create a new stream, navigate to the ``work`` tab and follow the steps below:

1.  Click the ``New Stream`` button to add your first stream.
2.  Give your stream a name and provide more description, where necessary, about what the stream is about.
3.  Assign the stream to yourself or other people in your team by clicking on the ``Assignee

!!! note "streams are for everyone"
    For better visibility, your entire team, including non-techinical people can use Lepsta to manage their work. The difference between coding streams and non-coding streams is that coding streams require you to attach a repository while non-coding streams dont.

### Attaching a repository to a stream
For coding tasks you have to attach a repository to a stream so that the changes you make on the repository can be replicated to this stream. If you dont have a repository please check the ``manage-repository`` guide. Once you have done that, you can simply click this button to select a repository to attach to the stream you want to work on.

### Start working
To get started with your coding task click the ``start coding`` button as shown below.

### Editing code locally or online
This is a crutial step as you are required to choose whether you want to edit your code locally or online. To edit code locally select ``edit locally``. This option will switch your streams from the default stream to the stream you want to work on. Once you have done that you can go to your repository locally and start coding using an IDE of your choice. Choosing the ``edit online`` option will let you code on your browser.

### Updating the status of a stream 
You can simply change the status of your stream by clicking the ``Action`` button on the image below.

However, the status of coding streams get updated automatically as you work on your code. For instance when you start coding, the status will moved to ``started`` and when you request for a code review the status will move to ``Review`` and when you commit your changes the status will automaticall move to ``completed``.

## What to know before contributing
Lepsta is a software development platform that helps developers get more productivity by automating parts of what the developer has to do (which includes versioning).
 - Tightening the feedback loop to ensure that collaborators can easily give feedback to each other without any overheard
 - Lastly through hooks, Lepsta can help the developer detect issues in their code while they are still cheap to fix.
